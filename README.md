# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

For Project 0, I created [a small website](https://djn0.github.io/cs50w-project0/) to display some pictures of my trip to Japan as well as to share useful resources for visiting Japan. Here is a description of what's contained in each file:

##### CSS folder

- styles.scss - Sass file with styling for each page
- styles.css - Converted CSS file
- styles.css.map

##### IMG folder

- Contains images used in the website

##### Main folder

- about.html - Two column page using Bootstrap 4's grid system
- contact.html - Dummy contact form
- index.html - Pictures of my trip presented using Bootstrap's cards component
- jp-links.html - Table of links for tourists to Japan
